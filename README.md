# RSA Algorithm Implementation in Python with Chinese Remainder Theorem

## Description
This project implements the RSA algorithm in Python, including the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for faster decryption. It provides functionalities for key generation, encryption, and decryption using the RSA algorithm. The project also includes block creation and padding for secure message transmission.

## Features
- Key generation: Generate public and private RSA keys.
- Encryption: Encrypt messages using the recipient's public key.
- Decryption: Decrypt encrypted messages using the recipient's private key.
- Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT): Utilize CRT for faster decryption.
- Block creation: Split large messages into blocks for efficient encryption.
- Padding: Apply padding techniques to ensure secure message transmission.
